# Introduction

The projecter package is a small collection of functions that make my
life easier. It contains some wrappers with somewhat sensible defaults
for setting up a README, Rprofile, and Table of Contents scripts. The
main function is `project()`, which does all three. The package also
contains some convenience functions for wrangling data. This is very
much a work in progress, and mostly set up for my own peace of mind. But
feel free to yoink anything you like.

# Installation

You can install the development version of projecter from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ChrisDonovan307/projecter")
