# Introduction

The projecter package is a small collection of functions that have made
my life easier navigating projects. They are mostly wrappers for common
functions that save time typing. This is very much a work in progress.

# Installation

You can install the development version of projecter from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ChrisDonovan307/projecter")
```
